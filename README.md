# Discord-Webhook-Python-CLI
A Python based app that posts messages to discord via the command line using Discord Webhooks

## Usage
The app has two main functions, posting a message specified in the command line (--message flag), or opening a file and posting each line (--lines flag). In order to use this application, you must also have a Discord Webhook URL that is specified in the --url flag. This can be created by right clicking on a discord server you own, clicking on the server settings menu, and then clicking on the intigration tab. In this menu, you can create a webhook that can then be coppied and pasted into this script!
